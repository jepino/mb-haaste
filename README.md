# MB-Haaste

**Simple full stack application for testing people applying for Mad Booster**

Application manages list of customers and contacts. `Express` server provides records over `REST API` for frontend written with `react`, bootstrapped with `vite`. `Redux` is used for state management and styles with good ol' `bootstrap`

Project is meant to measure applicant's skills of reading and writing code with a similar environment used at Mad Booster.

## The Task

Explore the project and figure out what all the things it does.

Project is filled with comments starting with `MB-TODO`. These comments are instuctions for improving the existing code and adding functionalities to the project. Search for `MB-TODO` and complete these little tasks as you see fit.

Frontend also has `<MBTodo />` component which gives a visible representation of possible tasks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code is not perfect! It contains common flaws and imperfections so do whatever you want with the code! Modify, remove, lint, expand, etc. to improve it ðŸš€.

We want to see how would you think and solve these kinds of problems. It is all up to you how you want to showcase your understanding of `javascript`, `react`, `REST APIs` and but also a skill of interpreting someone else's code.

Whenever you are ready let us know by sending the modified code e.g. via Github or what ever methods suits you and let's have a chat.

You can hit us up at `kehitys@madbooster.com`.
