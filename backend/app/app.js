 * MB-DONE: What are middlewares in Express?

 * "Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
 *  and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle." - https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html
 * 
 * Middlewares perform a specific task such as handling user authentication, writing response headers or fetching data from a database.
 * In an express app, they are chained to form pipelines that contain all the necessary logic to handle incoming requests.
